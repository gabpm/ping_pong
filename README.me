Ping-Pong with BDD
To start off our first week of Ruby, write a Ruby method on the Fixnum class that takes a number from the user and returns a list of numbers and strings that correspond to the Ping-Pong solution (i.e., 7.pingpong() returns [1, 2, "ping", 4, "pong", "ping", 7]).

To start off, write plain English versions of your specs, in the order you'd implement them. Here is the first one to get you started: "The Ping-Pong method counts from 1 to a given number. For example, we expect an input of 2 to return the array [1, 2]."

Have a teacher check your plain English versions before you start any coding. Then, remember, to write the RSpec spec for the simplest behavior, implement it, refactor, and then start again with the next spec.
